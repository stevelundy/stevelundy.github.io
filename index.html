  <h1>Steve Lundy</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

  <p>As a passionate and motivated expert in online learning design and curriculum development, I have spent the past 15+ years delivering world-class research, programs, and online courses. With a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, I am a driven and detail-oriented project manager who has experience leading cross-functional teams in onboarding, discovery, research, IT, and impact-oriented learning design. I am an award-winning facilitator, researcher, and speaker on Universal Design for Learning, user-centered design, and instructor-led training.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am a Project Manager at the University of Texas at Austin, where I have been working since 2013. In this role, I have supervised learning design, studio & IT workflows, and have worked with internal and external stakeholders to deliver an average 2x year-on-year increase in capacity in courses and enrollments. I have managed development, LMS (Canvas), curricula, assessment, and evaluation for 100+ online learning experiences (programs, courses, products) for 2-5K learners per semester and 50K+ to date.</p>
  <p>I have also designed user research studies of student satisfaction surveys in online courses to identify 60% to 90% growth in excellent/very good ratings. I have developed compassionate interventions for learner engagement, including survey instruments demonstrating 90%+ satisfaction with measures adopted. I have driven the largest-ever summer capacity for 20% of total university enrollment (total 10K learners) by transforming workflows and documentation for SME-onboarding, collaboration, and course development.</p>
  <p>I have expanded system-wide DEI training capacity for high-level stakeholders from 200 to 1K participants per year by developing empathic, interactive, and reusable digital content to achieve 5x reach. I have pioneered campus-wide programs for inclusivity, including innovative trauma-informed pedagogy training, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) working groups, and bystander intervention workshops, yielding 90%+ learner satisfaction response to inclusive measures.</p>
  <p>I have excelled in cross-functional project management for high-impact learning experiences, driving audio-video production, graphics, software and media development, planning, execution, documentation, engagement, and feedback assessment, data analysis, and reporting, with 1000+ deliverables. I have designed and facilitated virtual training on eLearning for 500+ educators during the COVID pandemic, ensuring excellence, continuity, and compliance while minimizing disruption for teachers & learners.</p>
  <p>I have also held the role of Research Fellow, where I researched, designed, and orchestrated a complete suite of online and hybrid courses for the Department of Classics, enrolling 20K+ learners to date for 1.5x year-on-year growth and reversing declines in enrollment. I have innovated groundbreaking best practices for learner onboarding, developing the standard course onboarding model for online courses campus-wide.</p>
  <p>I hold a Doctor of Philosophy in Classical Languages and Literature from the University of Texas at Austin, and a Master of Arts in Classical Languages and Literature from the same institution. I also hold a Bachelors of Arts in Classics/Literae Humaniores from the University of Oxford (Wadham College).</p>
  <p>My key skills include Curriculum Development & Management, Online & Hybrid Learning Design, Project Management, Research & Discovery, Verbal & Written Communication, Public Speaking & Event Facilitation, Trauma-informed Design & UDL, and LMS Management (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.).</p>
